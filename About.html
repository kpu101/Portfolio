                &ebsp As ChatGPT is popular worldwide, I am intrigued in how to explain deep models like ChatGPT and gain insights from them. 
                In contemporary machine learning, the models have been evolved into an astonishing step These deep models have excellent 
                performance they are also notorious for their low explainable power. Unveiling the model’s structure and insights are 
                paramount to utilize and improve the model. Explainable AI is my research interest, and I would be delighted for any 
                chances to study deciphering those deep model’s insights.

                &ebsp The Applied Data Science in Syracuse University allowed me to raise my knowledge of machine learning and deep learning to a new plateau and I am honored to study in the program. The ADS program in Syracuse University provides systematic machine learning curriculum from scratch and helps students build a robust basis from statistics and coding to complex deep learning models. What’s more, iSchool repeatedly emphasizes the importance of data analysis skills besides building machine learning models. During the ADS program, I got to hone my communication, data visualization, research skills throughout different assignments and projects. My direction is conduct natural language processing using different models, while ADS program also provides other tracks like data engineering, business analytics, and data visualization, which can be tailored to different study plans according to each student’s goals.
